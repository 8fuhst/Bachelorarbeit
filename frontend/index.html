<h1>Keystroke Data Collection</h1>
<p>Hey, and thank you for participating in my study! On the next page, you will be asked to type
    some randomly selected words in a textfield. Once you've completed a word, the next one will automatically
    appear. You can type as many words as you like, there is no finish line, data is saved after every word.
    If you make a typo, just correct it and finish the word normally. Do mind that the same word can appear two
    times in a row - once the textfield is cleared, you're good to go!</p>

<p> Please note, that the intention of this study is to collect data via keyboards. Thus, please refrain
    from using this website with a mobile, tablet, or other touch based input devices!</p>

<p>Before you start, please provide some information about you. All data will be anonymized with an id
    that cannot be traced back to you.</p>
